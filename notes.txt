Optimization techniques:

1.Greedy approach:
To select the best option we use greedy approach i.e., to maximize profits, minimize costs under given conditions.

2.Divide and conquer approach:
A big problem is going to divided into no.of smaller problems so that they can be easily solved.And solution of all the sub problems are combined to splve the actual larger problem.
For example: Largest number in a list of 8 elements.
Here list is divide into a half i.e 2 lists of 4 elements each. Again these 2 lists are divide into halfs i.e., 2 elemented lists are created. Finally there will be 4 lists of size 2. Here can compare the elements of the lists and an findout the larger of the 2 elements. Again larger of 1st numbers is found.Similarly the next 2 numbers are compared. And finally largest is computed. 


EXCEPTION PROPAGATION AND CALL STACK:
When a method is called it is going to be on the stack and when the method returns then method id removed from the stack.
Try block-----acutual code (ex: division)
Catch block----to handle the exception (ex: ArithmeticException e    and return 0)
Finally block----to close the onnection
"throw" clause is used to propate the exception.When exception is not handled at any method then the exception reaches the main() method and then main() throws this to jvm, jvm terminates the program and displays the exception statement on the console.

DEFENSIVE CODING AND EXCEPTION HANDLING:
Look before you leap-----defensive coding
Easier to ask forgiveness than permission-----exception handling

USER DEFINED EXCCEPTIONS AND THROW CLAUSE:
AUTOMATED SOFTWARE TESTING:
Software testing is done to 
-check the errors/buggs in the software
-find efficiency of the software
Types of testing:
1.Black box testing:
Here some inputs and outs are given and functionality is checked. EX:Money withdrawl from the atm machine without knowing how the opeartion is done internally.
-Programming knowledge is not required
-Independent software testers take care of it
2.White box testing:
Here functionality of the software is tested, internal structure or design is tested by the tester.
-Programming knowledge is required
-Software developers take care of it
Functional Testing(What system does) and Non functional Testing(how system does):

UNIT TESTING MASTER CLASS:
JUnit5:
----JUnit is the most popular Java unit testing framework. An open-source framework, it's used to write and run repeatable automated tests.
To creat tests for your project:
1.right click 
2.select generate
3.click on test
4.select junit5
5.Click on file name & right click, select open module settings
6.Click on projects
7.click on "+" symbol then java
8.then add the jar files one by one.
On the test file write the code
THERE WILL BE 3 PARTS IN THE TEST FILE:
1.ARRANGE--------object of the class is created here
2.ACT---------- parameters like strings are passed to the method or function(METHOD IS CALLED HERE).
3.ASSERT------actual output is compated with the produced output
Downloading testing frameworks:
Testing the software
1.Go to junit jupiter api 
2.Click on the first link
3.Download the latest version jar file(I have downloaded the jar 5.5.2 version for junit5)
4.Next download dependencies like junit platform commons (Downloaded the jar 1.5.2 version) 
5.Next download the another dependency i.e., hamcrest all(Downloaded the jar 1.3 version)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22/5/2023
WRITING PARAMETERIZED TESTS:
1.Download the dependency junit jupiter params jar file(Downloaded apr10, 2020 version)
RUNNING TEST SUITES
---Test suite is used to bundle a few unit test cases and run them together. In JUnit, both @RunWith and @Suite annotations are used to run the suite tests
---TO identify the gaps between the tests
---In a series of tests first test has to be completed to begin the next tests
1.Download the dependency---junit platform suite api jar file 1.6.2
2.Download the dependency----junit jupiter engine 5.6.2
3.Download the dependency----junit platform suite api 1.6.2

@Tag annotation is used to filter the test cases from the test plants

@Test indicates it is a test method

@DisplayName it is custom method to display a msg
MOCKITO TESTING
Creates a mock object nothing but the clone of the object that is under test.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TDD MASTER CLASS-1:
----Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases before developing the actual code.
----TDD is a software development process which includes test-first development. It means that the developer first writes a fully automated test case before writing the production code to fulfil that test and refactoring.
Steps in TDD:
1.Add tests
2.See tests fail
3.Write code 
4.Run tets
5.Refactor
Cycle repeats



GENERICS TYPE:
---Generics in OOP allow us to define a specification of a class or method that can be used with any data type.
----Java Generics is a set of related methods or a set of similar types. Generics allow types Integer, String, or even user-defined types to be passed as a parameter to classes, methods, or interfaces. Generics are mostly used by classes like HashSet or HashMap.
--WE donot need to type cast the results
GENERIC CLASSES CAN STORE AN OBJECT OF TYPE.
GENERIC METHODS:
Generic methods any type of arguments like int,string,float etc and return any type.
SYNTAX:
public static<E>void printarray(E[] inputarray)-------HERE E INDICATE TYPE PARAMETER

GENERIC INHERITANCE AND SUBTYPE:
when subclass extends a super class the operations performed in the super class will be added to the opeartions present in the subclass.So, as a results both the opeartions will be displayed on the console. 

GENERIC COLLECTIONS:

The generic collections are introduced in Java 5 Version. The generic collections disable the type-casting and there is no use of type-casting when it is used in generics. The generic collections are type-safe and checked at compile-time. Generic collections allow datatypes to pass as parameters to the classes.

EXPLORING JAVA 8'S LATEST FEATURES:
LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS:
----A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method 
----The Lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has functional interface. It saves a lot of code. In case of lambda expression, we don't need to define the method again for providing the implementation.

JAVA INTERFACES:
There should not be any access specifiers for the method signatures(method names within the java interfaces) in the java interface beacuse by default they are considered as public and abstarct by java and an interface must be of public access specifier.

TO WRITE THE METHODS WE CAN WE USE INTELLIJ SHORTCUTS:
1.Press alt+insert
2.Select implement methods
3.Select methods to implement
4.You can find the methods craeted there.
------>Default (or) defender methods---methods in the interface with implementaion and these defender methods do not make any any changes in the classes which are implementing the interface.
------>Static methods inside the inteface can be called only with the interface name followed by the method name.
------>Similarly the variables declared and initialized inside the interface also needs int interface name followed by the method name.


STREAMS:

OPTIONAL CLASS IN JAVA:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25/5/2023

READ AND WRITE TO A FILE:
Inorder to read from a file or write into a file we need import the java.io.* package.
TO WRITE INTO THE FILE:
1.Need to create a BufferedWriter object using the command
2.BufferedWriter br=new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("copy the path where we want to write and a new file name "))
3.Keep them in a try block
4.To add a text use bw.write("pushpanjali") inside the try block.
5.Use bw.close() to close
6.Use a catch block to indicate an exception if there is any

SIMILARLY WE CAN READ FROM A FILE AND ALSO CAN COPY CONTENTS OF A FILE INTO ANOTHER.

FILES AND STREAMS:
Java uses streams to read from the files or to write into the files permanently.
In the command System.in----->System indicates the class and in is the STREAM.There are other streams also like out, err variables. out and err referes to the default output device i.e., console.
Java applications use input streams to read data from the source devices like socket, array and files similarly uses output streams to to write data to destination like files, arrays, socket etc.
Mainly there are 2 types of streams 
1.Byte streams--to read or write byte data
2.Character streams---to read or write character data

INPUT STREAM AND OUTPUT STREAM CLASSES:
BUFFERED INPUT STREAM AND BUFFERED OUTPUT STREAM:

STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE:
--Database--->A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS)
---RDBMS-->A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program used to create, update, and manage relational databases.
--SQL is used for programming and designed to manage the data held in relational database management systems(RDBMS) and to perform operations on the RDBMS.
--MySQL is a open source RDBMS which runs on a server and it is developed, distributed and supported by oracle corporation.
SQL commands:
1.Data Definition Language(DDL): CREATE, ALTER, DROP, 
2.Data Manipilation Language(DML): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
3.Transaction Control Language(TCL): COMMIT, ROLLBACK,SAVE POINT
4.Data Control Language(DCL): GRANT, REVOKE
5.Data Query Language(DQL): SELECT

desc--->the describe command is used to display a table that is created. ex: desc table_name
TO fetch data form a table use the command--> Select * from table_name;

SQL constraints: -----rules or protocols that the table's columns must follow to maintain accuracy, and integrity of the table's data 
 1.Primary key:

	A primary key is a column or group of columns that uniquely identifies each row.And it should not a null. 
 2.Unique:
	Unique constraint ensures that all columns should have unique value in them.
 3.Not Null:
	Not Null constraint is used to ensure that the columns of the table should not hold any null value.
 4.Foreign key:
	In SQL, a Foreign Key is a column (or combination of columns) in a table whose values match the values of a Primary Key column in another table. Using the   	Foreign key, we can link two tables together.
 5.Check:
	To check a criteria we can use it. This command will not work in mysql but works in sqlserver.
 6.Default
	To ssign a data defaultly we can use it
--DROP: when we drop a database or table it will not exist anymore.
syntax: DROP table <table name>;

DATABASE DESIGN:

TYPES OF DATA MODELS:
1.OBJECT BASED DATA MODEL---	entity relationship model ER model
2.RECORD BASED DATA MODEL--network model,hierarchical model, the relational models

DATABASE NORMALIZATION: to minimize data redundancy in the database i.e., to reduce the insertion, deletion and updation anomalies(Or) problems.
Here entire table is divided into no.of tables which are interrelated to reduce the redundancy.
TYPES OF NORMALIZATION:
1.First normal form
2.Second normal form
3.Third normal form

JDBC API AND CRUD OPERATIONS:
open database connectivity(ODBC)
Fundamental steps in jdbc:
1.Open a connection to database
2.Create a statement object to perform a query
3.Execute sql query
4.Process result set

DATABASE CONNECTIVITY STEPS:
1.Register driver
2.Get connection
3.Create statement
4.Execute query
5.Close connection

BASICS OF HTML(HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE):
--To describe the template which is used to structure a web page we need html.
--HTML is used to design the web pages
--A markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. HTML (HyperText Markup Language), is an example of a markup language. Within a text file such as an HTML file, elements are marked up using tags which explain the purpose of that part of the content.
--Markup language is programming language that is used for processing, definition, presentation of text. 
BASIC SYNTAX OF HTML:
<start tag> content <stop tag>
ex:<p> content </p>
where p indicates paragraph, <p> start of paragraph and </p> indicates ending of paragraph.

HTML DOCUMENT STRUCTURE:
<!DOCTYPE html>//it indicates which type documents have to be expected by the web browser
<html>
	<head>
		<!-- contains titles , scripts, description, styles and meta tags  etc -->
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- content visible on web page -->
	</body>
</html>

---Content inside the body tags include paragraphs, images, links, videos, audio players, maps, froms etc.
---The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. 
---Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
--Everything inside body tags is displayed on the browser window.

--TAGS IN HTML:
1.<h1> to <h6>:
To display the titles and sub titles on the web pages we need heading tags. The tags start from <h1> to <h6>.<h1> most important heading on the web page and <h6> indicates the least important tiles or sub titles.

2.<p>:
For writing paragraphs.

3.<a>:
To link a part of the code with anothe element  of the code with the another element.
	<a href="https://stackbooks-ust.stackroute.in">https://stackbooks-ust.stackroute.in</a>

4.<div>:
--<div> is used to dividide the html document as sections.
---<div> tags act as container for html elements.
--DIV tag lets you identify the section defined by the DIV tag, so you can then apply formatting or scripting to its content

5.<img>:
To embedd an image inside the webpage
	<img src="https link address" height="1000" width="1000" >

6.<ul> unordered list, here list items are marked with bullets
7.<ol> ordered list, here list items are marked with numbers
8.<li> list element
9.<table> create table, i.e., to display data in tabular form 
10.<tr> to create row in a table.
11.<th> to create heading to the tables
12.<td> to enter data into the table
13.<audio> is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams.
14.<video> used to embed video content in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams

NOW TO CREATE FORM IN THE WEB PAGE:
We will use the form tags, input tags to fetch the details entered by the user and labels for input heading
The <br> tag inserts a single line break. The <br> tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.

HTML ATTRIBUTES:
1.class
2.src
3.id
4.name
5.alt
6.href---url of the page

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW WEB 2.0 WORKS

----In web 1.0 the contents of the web pages are static which means there were no possibilty to change the content after publishing it. Ex: online news pages, website containing the personal info of person which is never going to change. web 1.0 lasted between 1990 to 2004.
---Web 2.0 is more interactive which allows users to post their content on fb, insta, twitter etc and allows them to interact with one anothe.
EX:Online purchases, youtube( where users can subscribe to the youtuber's page and comment to their uploaded videos etc) are also examples of web 2.0.

---Web 2.0 allows to create more collabrative, interactive, social and responsive web pages.
ADVANTAGES OF WEB 2.0
1.updatable content--insta, fb
2.team collabration---zoom, slack, linkedin connections
3.feedback collection------reviews on a product purchased, comments on a youtube video, zomato ratings etc.
4.online payment service--google pay, 
5.geo navigation--google map

---WEB 3.0 provides the data according to the user's interests.makes use of semantics, ai, 3d graphics, ubiquitos.

CSS BOX MODEL:
---CSS box models indicate how the html elements are modeled in browser engines and how the html elements are dimesioned from the css properties.
---The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag. EX:<p>paragraph</p>   it is html element.
---In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
---The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

CSS BOX MODEL includes:
(margin(border(padding(content))))

HTML FORM AND INPUTS:

html form elements are useed when we want to collect information from the web page visitors like email id, name, mobile number, gender details, age etc.
HTML form elements:
1.input
2.button
3.label---to give a caption to the input field
4.output
5.datalist
6.legend
7.fieldset---to group similar elements
7.textare
8.<select><option>
9.optgroup

FORM ATTRIBUTES

[]CSS BUILDING BLOCKS:
###To style the web page we need css cascading style sheet.
-->CSS KEY CONCEPTS:
CSS STYLE RULES:

CSS rules contain 3 parts:
1.selector EX:body,paragraph,navigation,anchor tags etc.
2.Definition ---->everything inside the curly braces.
3.property and property value. EX:color:navy respectively.
--To use any css code inside any html file we need link the css file with html file and it is possible with the help of link element.
--As we now styles can be added as embedded i.e., inside the head tags style tag will be there, inline i.e., inside the paragraph tag or anyother tag there will be the style attribute or external i.e., a separate css file also known as style sheets with the required changes made with, when all of them or some them are present,the nthe closest stytle will be applied to the html elements.

CSS style rule selection:
1.ID selector:
When we want to make changes to only few elemets and some other changes to other elements then we can use ID SELECTOR.A nd the id's should be unique.
Use #symbol with the id to add  styles to a specific id.
2.Class selector:
For example we want our header and footer should be of same styles like background color, font-family etc then we will use the "class" inside the header and footer.
Inside the stylesheet we have to write the .class name to define the styles.

MORE CSS FEATURES:
TEXT STYLING:
1.Font styles
2.Text layout styles

ADDING FONTS IN CSS:
FONT FAMILY:it is property 
1.Specific font family--ex:times new roman, areal,verdana
2.Generic font family--suported by all the browsers,  serif,fantasy,monospace,cursive,sans-serif
WHEN WE DO NOT WANT TO USE THE FONTS IN HTML WE CAN USE THE GOOGLE FONTS ALSO.

WEB FONTS:
Web fonts are not free to use we need to pay for it or we should have some license to use them.

INTRODUCTION TO CSS FLEX BOX:
What is use of flexbox in CSS?
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that we can use to create a row or a column axis layout. It makes our life easier to design and build responsive web pages without having to use tricky hacks and a lot of float and position properties in our CSS code.
The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. Browser Support.

We have css flex box properties like
1.display:flex---------------to enable the flex.
2.flex-direction:
3.flex-wrap: 
4.justity-content 
5.align-elements:
6.align-content:
7.overflow: properties also.

										JAVA SCRIPT

--->To create dynamic, interactive and user friendly web sites one should learn java script.
--->Client-side scripting: The code along with the html web page is sent to the client by the server.The refers to the script and here it is java script.
--->Java script is universally supported.
--->JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web. JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS. JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
To create in browser games, and change the color of buttons and allowing for zoom in and out features displaying the name of the button when the cursor hovers over it.
Every browser has a java script engine ex. firebox it is spider monkey and for chrome the javascript engine is v8.

JAVA SCRIPT HTML DOM(DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL):
When a web page is loaded browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
HTML DOM is standard for how to get,change, add or delete html elements.
With help of html dom java script can access and change all the elements of an html document. 

JAVA script is "dynamic type language" because we don't need to specify the data type of the variables.
Primitive data types:
--------- ---- -----
Data types predefined by the javascript are called promitive data types number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, BigInt.
Numbers can be used to display numbers between (-253-1) and 253-1 . to represent larger numbers than this we nedd BigInt. Numbers can be used to represent the float values, exponential values also.
Non-primitive data type:
Object--- having key-value property.

JAVA SCRIPT VALUES VS REFERENCE TYPES:

It is like call by value and call by reference.
In case of normal primitive data types the value of variables are stored on the stack memory, incase of non-primitive like arrays the address of the array variables are stored on the stack and value on the heap memories.
Arrays, functions are examples of refrence types.
--->We create the functions in javascript using the keyword "function".

JAVASCRIPT SCOPES:
Scopes in javascript define the accessibility of the variables, functions and the objects.

TYPES OF SCOPES IN JS:
1.Local scope    1.Function scope (Accessible inside the function only) 2.Block scope (Accessible inside the block only I.E., inside curly braces{}) 
2.Global scope   Variables defined outside the functions or at the top of the program. EX: var x=10, let p=100, const z=90, A=50

Block scope:
Variables declared with const an let keywords have the block scope.
Local variables are created when a function is called i.e., started end gets deleted when a function is completed.

VAR , LET, CONST IN JAVASCRIPT:

let and const have block scope and can not be redeclared in the same block.
var keyword has global scope and local scope also.
Inside a function var has local scope i.e., the function scope. 
Using var we can have "hosting".

Hoisting of var, const, let:

One of the benefits of hoisting is that it enables us to call functions before they appear in the code. JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
var---undefined

let and const variables are not initialized here. They are hoisted at the top and declared and not initialized.

Variables declared as const can not be reassigned values.
 
JAVA SCRIPT TEMPLATE LITERALS:
It provides more readability.
Template literals are written in backticks.(` `)
Template literals allow to display a string in multiple lines without using the new line character \n.
They support string interpolation. EX:   console.log(`hi ${str}`);

Tag templates are advanced form of template literals.
To pass arguments to the function we can use the tag templates. EX: const rer=functionname `value to be passed`.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JAVA SCRIPT LOOPS:
1.for loop
2.for-in loop
3.for-of loop
4.while                entry controlled loop
5.do-while	       exit controlled loop

What is the difference between for of and for in loops?
The for...of loop is used to iterate through the values of an iterable. The for...in loop is used to iterate through the keys of an object. The for...of loop cannot be used to iterate over an object.

Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over something. The main difference between them is in what they iterate over. The for...in statement iterates over the enumerable string properties of an object, while the for...of statement iterates over values that the iterable object defines to be iterated over

3.for-in loop should be used to iterate over non-array objects.

JAVA SCRIPT IF-ELSE CONDITION:
Conditional statement in JS:
1.IF
2.IF-ELSE
3.NESTED IF    NO.OF  IF STATEMENTS IN THE PROGRAM.
4.IF-ELSE LADDER
5.SWITCH CASE

ARRAYS AND STRINGS IN JS:

Types of arrays:
1.Associative arrays : key value pairs can be seen here, keys are allotted with arrays here.[] 
2.Index arrays  :values are accessed using the index values.

1.associative arrays:
var character=[];
character["vowels"]="aeiou";
character["consonants"]="remaining all characters";

2.index arrays:
var fruites=["apples","kiwi","banana"];
console.lof(fruites[1]);

Declaration of arrays in js:
1.using new keyword.  ex:new Array(1,2,56,8)
2.using i.e., assigning the literals inside [] brackets.
3.using Array.of() method

ARRAY METHODS:
1.push --- to add an element at the position
2.pop --- to delete an element at the last position
3.lenght----to find length
4.forEach
5.every
6.sort
7.reverse
8.concat
9.map       ----to transform array elements we use map method i.e., to use any required method, The Array.map() method creates a new array from the results of calling                          
		a function for every element.
10.unshift ---- to add an element at the begining
11.filter method

ARRAY ATTRIBUTES:
1.length---appends new element at the end
2.indexOf-----return index of the specified element
3.typeOf-----returns type of the array

JAVA SCRIPT STRINGS:
Creating strings :
1.string literals     var s1="yeppp"
2.using string objects   var s2=new String("yeppp")

Strings features:
1.immutable
2.case sensitive

Accessing string characters:

1.charAt(index) -------> s1.charAt(1)
2.using index   ------->  s1[1]

String methods:

1.concat
2.charAt(index)
3.split        --------converts a string into array of strings
4.replace      -------to replace a string another string
5.toLowerCase()
6.tpUpperCase()
7.slice(start,end) ----returns a part of string
8.substring(start,end)---return a part of string
9.substr(start,length)
10.trim() ------removes white spaces from the string
11.includes()-----searches for a string and returns boolean value
12.search()  -----seartches for a string and returns position of match

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JAVA SCRIPT FUNCTIONS:

1.Anonymous functions: Where a function definition is assigned to a variable. and to call a function we do not need to use the function's name instead we can use the variable to which the function body is assigned. EX: greet();
Anonymous functions do not have names.

Function Hoisting:

Function hoisting is possible with function declarations only and not with the function expressions i.e., when a function definition is assigned to a variable and that variable is used to invoke the function.

Self-invoking functions:
When we keep the entire function definition inside the() and then place (); after using the paranthesis then it becomes self invoking functions.

They are invoked even without calling.

Functions as VALUES:
Assigning function call to a variable and we do not need to call the function separately.

Functions as OBJECTS:

js functions have both properties and methods.
The no.of parameters passed to a function can be known with the help of "arguments.length" property.

Using .toString() method we can convert any type of data into string.

ARRAY FUNCTIONS:

Here we do not need the function keyword and curly braces and return statement if the function is of single line only but it is always good to keep them in the programs. EX: const z= (x,y)=> x*y;

Array functions can not be hoisted.

Generator FUNCTIONS:
These functions return multiple values when demanded. * is used after the function keyword in the function definition.

Predefined Functions In Javascript:

1.eval() evaluates a string and return a value
2.parseInt() Parses a string argument and return an integer value.
3.parseFolt() Parese a string argument and returns a floating-point value.
4.escape() return hexadecimal encoding of an argument.
5.unescape() returns ASCII string for the specified value.

JAVSCRIPT CLIENT SIDE:

Client side APIs(Application Programming Interface):
--->APIs enable connection between the computers or computer programs.
--->APIs are software interfaces that offers services to other softwares to enhance the required functionalities.
--->They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in it's place.
--->EX: When ever we ckeck the weather or travel ticket on smart phone an api is called at the backend.

WEB APIS:
--->Can be accessed over the web using http protocol.
--->Enhanced form of web aoolication
--->Extends the functionality of the browser.
--->Simplifies complex functions.
--->Provides easy syntax to complex codes.
How they work:
WEB APIs receive requests from different client devices like mobiles, laptops etc and then send it to the web server to process these requests and produce the required ouput.
1.CLIENT SIDE WEB API
2.SERVER SIDE WEB API

CLIENT SIDE JAVA SCRIPT APIS:
1.Browser APIS  Built in browser
EXAMPLES:
	1.DOM APIS-----to change the html and css tags in html webpage
	2.APIs that fetch data from server
	3.Audio and Video APIs
	4.Device APIs
	5.Client-side storage APIs.
2.Third party APIS:
These apis allow to use the respestive applications on the browser.
EXAMPLES:
	1.Youtube API
	2.Google maps api
	3.Spotify api
	4.facebook api
	5.twitter api
	
FORM VALIDATION USING JAVA SCRIPT:
JavaScript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server.

TYPE SCRIPT IS A OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WHERE AS JS IS A SCRIPTING LANGUAGE
INTRODUCTION TO TYPE SCRIPTING PART-1:Features, typeannoatation, conditional statements
INTRODUCTION TO TYPE SCRIPTING PART-2:Access members:public, private, protecteds, typescript functions:normal and anonymous functions, interfaces.Typescript class and module, typescript decorators, type script ambients.

										ANGULAR

IT IS A POPULAR PLATFORM TO CREATE APPLICATIONS OF ENTERPRISES.and it uses type script where as ANGULARJS uses javascript.
Angular is popular framework provided by the google to create Single Page Applications(SPAs) using html and typescript.
Types of web applications:
1.Single pasge applications.   When we click on anything on the website reloads the entire page EX:Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, GitHub, and numerous Google's services 				are all built using the SPA tech
2.Multi page applications.     No reload happens when we click something on webpage.  EX: Amazon and eBay are the leading examples of multi-page applications.

--->As per the name suggests single page applications consists just one single page. SPAs present the content in an easy, elegant and effective way as it loads all the content on just one single page rather than navigating the user to different pages. SPAs are faster than traditional web applications because they execute the logic in the web browser itself rather than on the server. And after the initial page load, only data is sent back and forth instead of the entire HTML that reduces the bandwidth.

--->Multi-page applications are the traditional web applications that reload the entire page and displays the new one when a user interacts with the web app. Each time when a data is exchanged back and forth, a new page is requested from the server to display in the web browser. This process takes time to generate the pages on the server, sending it to a client and displaying in the browser which may affect the user experience.
